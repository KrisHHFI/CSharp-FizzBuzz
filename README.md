# C# FizzBuzz Program

### About

- A very basic FizzBuzz program, which goes through the numbers 1 to 100.
- If the number is a multiple of 3 then "Fizz" is printed, if its a multiple of 5 "Buzz" is printed and if its a multiple of both "Fizz Buzz" is printed. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met, then the number itself is printed.
- Part of a series of FizzBuzz programs I have posted, all of which are following the same logic.

### Run the program

- Ensure your machine can run C# programs. if not, check the latest guidance.
- Navigate to the file location via your terminal.
- Execute the command: dotnet run
